## BeagleEye Project Setup for development

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install python-pip libopencv-* libmysqlclient-dev
   sudo pip install virtualenv
   ```
Some libaries that are used with OpenCV are: ( First set for read / write of images and second for I/O from the device, last third group is for optimization routines in OpenCV
```sh
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev libtiff4-dev libjasper-dev libpng12-dev
sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran
```

   Create a projects folder in the user home directory.  Create a beagleeye folder in the projects directory.

   ```sh
   virtualenv env
   ```
   Now you have a virtual environment to play in.  While in the beagleeye directory, you should now have a directory named - env


   ```sh
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

   You are now using the virtual directory.  Install the python dependencies but be aware that scipy takes 60-100 minutes to install when directly on the beaglebone.

   ```sh
   pip install numpy scipy mysqldb pytesseract Adafruit_BBIO
   cp /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cv* 'your directory here'/projects/BeagleEye/BeagleEye/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
   ```

   Give your user video access
   ```sh
   sudo usermod -a -G video 'your user name here'
   ```
